# Mark-Checker
A lightweight Discord bot that automatically checks new users against the FraudShield API upon joining the server. The bot alerts staff with detailed logs, assigns roles like "Scammer" or "DWC" (Doing With Caution) to flagged users, and helps maintain a safe environment by preventing fraud and scams in your Discord community.
